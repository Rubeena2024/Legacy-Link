I've always been drawn to hackathons and development, but various challenges kept me from participating until now. From two years of online learning to intense placement preparation and occasionally not making the cut for larger hackathons, it was quite a journey. However, I was thrilled to finally take part in my very first hackathon, even if it was on a smaller scale. I approached it with utmost dedication, coding day and night for two full days, planning potential solutions, and crafting a full-stack application that would typically take weeks ‚Äì all thanks to my incredible teammate, Premchand Maddikuntla . Prem, your expertise in tech was nothing short of remarkable, and I'm grateful for your support.

The experience was an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of learning and growth. While this hackathon may not have been as massive as some, it pushed me to give my best in both development and team collaboration.

                üèÜ I'm thrilled to announce that our team, Brainstormers, clinched the 1st Prize in the "PITCH THE PECULIAR*" hackathon hosted by the Sahyog The Mentorship Club NIT RAIPUR ! üåü
                
                Our winning project, "Doubt Smasher," is a web app designed to foster a close-knit community for solving academic and tech-related queries. We understand that students often seek a go-to peer group working on the same tech or facing similar academic challenges to enhance their learning journey. With this in mind, our app creates an environment where students can connect, both online through chatrooms and offline within the campus. This ensures they have the support they need to clear concepts and boost their learning curve because we truly learn better together..</p>

            <p class="post-description">It's june already, I remember last year at this time, I was all into placement preps doing InterviewBit and hackerrank simultaneously, revising Core Cs topics all while trying to complete my summer internship project.
 
                I know this time is crucial and hectic but believe me do take breaks and don't let yourself burnout doing same thing(coding/Core Cs) for the whole day keep an alternate schedule if you don't feel like doing a particular task.
                
                I want to highlight the importance of revision at this point, keep a note of something new that you came across in a contest question and go through it again before the next contest, that's how you grow.
                
                Keep your resume explainably simple - emphasize on major tech stacks and achievements and be ready to answer on any keyword present in it. Projects on your resume should have some purpose, don't keep projects just to showcase a techstack. 
                
                Remember to keep yourself motivated and learn to pat your own back when no one else does. You are stronger than you think you are !! 
                Keep the below pic in mind. Have faith in your own abilities and keep grinding, You are just two feet from your gold.
                
                Hope this placement season things turn out better than the last year</p>

            <p class="post-description">My life story:

                If I won‚Äôt more than 90% in boards, I will not be able to get PCM...
                
                If I won‚Äôt clear JEE, I will not be able to do anything in my life‚Ä¶
                
                If I don‚Äôt crack big tech companies, I won‚Äôt be able to live good life‚Ä¶
                
                If I don‚Äôt get promoted on time, my career trajectory will be slow‚Ä¶
                
                If I don‚Äôt make enough income, I won‚Äôt be able to help my family financially‚Ä¶
                
                Summary: No matter what I achieved, I had next thing ready on my plate to get worried about.
                
                So, even if people say, take a chill pill rest out, take your time. Never believe, cause everyone's waiting for their turn to walk over and ahead of you.
                
                Honestly ,it‚Äôs tough to do but keep hustling. Cause time's not waiting for you, nor the world.
